 * other classes in the distribution should be referenced directly by client code.
 *
 * To track an event in your application,
 *
 * 1) create a Mixpanel instance using your project token
 *        Mixpanel tracker("MY_PROJECT_TOKEN")
 *
 * 2) call Mixpanel::track on your instance, with an event name
 *        and a (possibly empty) QVariantMap of event properties.
 *
 * The Mixpanel class is reentrant- you can use instances and copies
 * of instances from different threads.
